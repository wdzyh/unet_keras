# unet_keras
## This is the Keras implement of U-Net (train on own dataset)

## There are four file of python, you can implement main.py to run codes.

## I have to say sorry to you, I can't upload my data set for everyone to use, because it's our privacy. 

## You can put your data set in the corresponding folder, as follows:

├── ADEChallengeData2016  # images and annotations data

	├── images  # train and valid data
  
		├── training
		├── validation
    
	├── annotations  # train and valid data
  
		├── training
		├── validation
    
## These codes implement end-to-end classification issues.
## There are only two classes.
